# How to Write Text That Can't Be Detected using AI Detectors
Writing text using AI that AI detectors cannot detect is a task that needs advanced-level #prompt writing knowledge. But someone with basic #prompting knowledge can also do writing using AI that cannot be detected using AI detectors. It consists of the following steps:
1. Write some part of the text or the whole text yourself.
2. Then go to Chat GPT and you can use the following prompts to improve your writing.
a. "You are an expert technical writer. Rewrite this text with more clarity for readers. [Paste the text in the next line]."
b. "As an expert technical writer. Elaborate on this text for more user clarity. [Paste the text in the next line]."
3. You can improve the readability of text by using prompts like below.
a. "Rewrite the text with a more readability score. [Paste the text in the next line]."
b. "Rewrite the text so that it is easier for readers. [Paste the text in the next line]."
4. You can specify the details also like "Rewrite the text below and avoid passive voice in sentences. [Paste the text in the next line]."
5. Proofread the text generated by Chat GPT and ask for amendments as required.
6. Keep retrying the iterations until you get the text that meets your requirements.
7. Use any AI detector to check for AI-generated text. The ratio of AI-generated text will be negligible or even zero (in some scenarios) by using the above method.
